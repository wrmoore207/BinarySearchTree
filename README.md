# BinarySearchTree

## Project Description:
The Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation in C project is designed to provide a robust and efficient implementation of a binary search tree data structure in the C programming language. A binary search tree is a hierarchical data structure that allows for quick insertion, deletion, and retrieval of data in a sorted order.

## Features:

### Create a New BST:
* Initialize and create a new Binary Search Tree.

### Insertion:
* Add elements to the BST while maintaining the binary search tree properties.
* Handles duplicate values by not allowing duplicates (assuming duplicates are not allowed).

### Deletion:
* Remove elements from the BST while maintaining the binary search tree properties.

### Search:
* Search for a specific value within the BST.
* Return a boolean result indicating the presence or absence of the value.

### Traversal:
* Perform in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal of the BST.
* Print the elements in the desired order.

### Size and Empty Check:
* Get the current size of the BST.
* Check if the BST is empty.

### Sum Calculation:
* Calculate the sum of all elements in the BST.

### Memory Management:
* Efficient memory allocation and deallocation for the BST nodes.
